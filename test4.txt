The final step was to convert a human readable search into a query our system could understand, for this we created a syntax where we can decide to search for something based on the operators and meaning and and not respectively, we then evaluate each of these terms individually and place the results in a pool which we pass to a recursive function that intersects all of these results until no more sets than one exists and prints it for the user.
